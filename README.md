**What does this application do and why?**

* The objective is to click all of the Justin Timberlakes without clicking any of them twice. 
* Each time the user repeat clicks, the user loses, and the game restarts.
* When all Justins are clicked only once each, the user wins!

**How the application is organized**

This game is organized into the following files: 

* *public folder* - this contains the front-end display files.

* *src folder* - this contains the React files.

* *package.json* - this contains the information to tell your computer what npm packages to install. 

* Upon installation, a file called "package-lock.json" will appear, detailing which modules have been downloaded into the root folder.

* *README* - this file contains information about Justin.
